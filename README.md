## Features Overview

### Dispatch Operations
- **Live Dispatch Board** — Real-time Livewire-powered board with auto-refresh every 10 seconds (`wire:poll.10s`), so multiple dispatchers see each other's updates instantly
- **Trip Code Auto-fill** — Select a trip code and all fields (route, bus type, terminals, schedule, direction) populate automatically
- **Dual Driver Support** — Assign Driver 1 and Driver 2 per dispatch entry for co-driver trips
- **Dispatch Status Tracking** — Full lifecycle: Scheduled → Departed → On Route → Arrived (with Delayed and Cancelled states)
- **Daily Dispatch Days** — Initialize a dispatch day per date, add/edit/delete entries, reorder by sort order
- **Inline Add/Edit/Delete** — Modal dialogs powered by Livewire for adding and editing entries without page reloads

### Fleet & Vehicle Management
- **Vehicle Registry** — Full CRUD for fleet vehicles with bus number, brand, type, plate number, and status tracking
- **Vehicle Statuses** — OK (Available), Under Repair, For Maintenance (PMS), In Transit, Lutaw (Idle)
- **PMS Tracking** — Preventive Maintenance Schedule monitoring by kilometers or trip count
- **PMS Dashboard Alerts** — Vehicles at 80%+ PMS threshold appear as WARNING (orange) or OVERDUE (red) on the dashboard with progress bars
- **Idle Day Tracking** — Track how many days a vehicle has been unused

### Driver Management
- **Driver Registry** — Full CRUD with name, phone, license number, and active status
- **Quick Status Toggles** — Set drivers to Available, Dispatched, On Route, or On Leave with inline buttons
- **Active/Inactive Toggle** — Enable or disable drivers from being assigned
- **SMS to Drivers** — Send schedule notifications or custom messages via Semaphore API
- **Schedule Preview** — Preview the SMS schedule message before sending

### Driver Attendance
- **Daily Attendance Tracking** — Initialize attendance for each dispatch day, track check-in/check-out times
- **Status Management** — Mark drivers as On Time, Late (with minutes), Absent, or Excused
- **Auto-Absent Detection** — Scheduled command auto-marks absent drivers after configurable timeout
- **Configurable Thresholds** — Late threshold (default 15 min), pre-departure alerts (15 min), auto-absent timeout (30 min)
- **Attendance Alerts** — Automatic upcoming/late/absent alerts generated every 5 minutes
- **Mobile Check-in API** — REST API endpoints for future mobile app integration

### SMS Notifications
- **Semaphore Integration** — Philippine SMS provider for driver notifications
- **Queued Delivery** — SMS sent via database queue with 3 retries and 30-second backoff
- **Priority Messages** — Schedule notifications use the `high` queue priority
- **SMS Log Dashboard** — Admin view of all SMS history with sent/failed/pending stats
- **Retry Failed SMS** — One-click retry for failed messages from the SMS dashboard
- **Custom SMS** — Send custom messages (max 160 chars) to any driver from their management page

### Reporting
- **Daily Summary Reports** — Trip breakdown by direction (SB/NB) and destination (Naga, Legazpi, Sorsogon, Virac, Masbate, Tabaco, Visayas, Cargo)
- **Report Summary Table** — Paginated with date range filtering and aggregate totals
- **Excel Export** — Download dispatch data per day as `.xlsx`
- **PDF Export** — Download formatted reports as `.pdf`
- **Historical Records** — Search and filter past dispatch entries by bus, route, trip code, date range, direction, and status

### Administration & Security
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Three roles: Admin, Operations Manager, Dispatcher
- **Role-Based Dashboard** — Admin sees everything (audit logs, SMS stats, vehicle/driver stats, PMS alerts). Operations Manager sees vehicle stats + PMS alerts. Dispatchers see trip stats + quick dispatch actions
- **User Management** — Full CRUD with role assignment, phone number, and active/inactive toggle
- **Audit Log Viewer** — Searchable admin page tracking all CRUD operations with old/new value diffs, filterable by user, action, model type, and date range
- **Soft Deletes** — Drivers, Vehicles, Trip Codes, Dispatch Days, and Dispatch Entries use soft deletes with "Show Deleted" toggle and restore functionality in admin tables
- **Two-Factor Authentication** — Jetstream 2FA setup and management
- **Profile Photos** — Upload and manage profile photos (shown in sidebar)

## Architecture Notes

### Normalized Database (1NF-4NF)
The `daily_summaries` table uses a normalized `daily_summary_items` child table instead of hardcoded destination columns. Adding a new destination category requires zero schema changes.

### Audit Trail
The `Auditable` trait (applied to 6 models) automatically logs all create, update, delete, and restore operations with full old/new value diffs, user ID, and IP address.

### Soft Deletes
Drivers, Vehicles, Trip Codes, Dispatch Days, and Dispatch Entries support soft deletion. Admin tables include a "Show Deleted" toggle with one-click restore. Deleted records are preserved for audit integrity.

### Real-Time Updates
The dispatch board uses Livewire's `wire:poll.10s` for auto-refresh, allowing multiple dispatchers to see updates without manual page reloads.

### PMS (Preventive Maintenance Service)
Vehicles track current PMS value against a configurable threshold (by km or trips). Dashboard alerts surface vehicles at 80%+ threshold. Three preset PMS settings ship with the seeder.

### SMS Architecture
`SemaphoreService` → `SendSmsJob` (queued, 3 retries, 30s backoff) → `SmsLog`. All attempts are logged. Failed messages can be retried from the admin dashboard.

### Scheduled Commands
`attendance:check-alerts` runs every 5 minutes to detect upcoming, late, and absent drivers against configurable thresholds.

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start development server
composer run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Fresh database with sample data
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Run the queue worker (for SMS)
php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default

# Run attendance alert check manually
php artisan attendance:check-alerts

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Run tests
php artisan test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>"Address already in use" on port 8000</strong></summary>

```bash
# macOS / Linux
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows PowerShell
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess -Force
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MySQL "Access denied" or "Connection refused"</strong></summary>

Make sure MySQL is running. Check `.env` credentials match your MySQL setup.

```bash
# XAMPP: Open Control Panel → Start MySQL
# macOS: brew services start mysql
# Linux: sudo systemctl start mysql
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Switching between MySQL and SQLite</strong></summary>

Update `DB_CONNECTION` in `.env` to `mysql` or `sqlite`, create the database if needed, then run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Profile photos not showing</strong></summary>

Run `php artisan storage:link` to create the `public/storage` symlink.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>SMS not sending</strong></summary>

1. Check `SEMAPHORE_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. Run the queue worker: `php artisan queue:work`
3. Check SMS Logs at `/admin/sms-logs` for error details
</details>

   Set the following variables in your Railway web service:

   | Variable | Value | Notes |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | `APP_ENV` | `production` | Production environment |
   | `APP_DEBUG` | `false` | Disable debug mode |
   | `APP_KEY` | (generate locally) | Run `php artisan key:generate --show` |
   | `APP_URL` | `https://your-app.railway.app` | Your Railway domain |
   | `DB_URL` | `${{MySQL.MYSQL_URL}}` | Reference MySQL service URL |
   | `DB_CONNECTION` | `mysql` | Database driver |
   | `SESSION_DRIVER` | `database` | Session storage |
   | `CACHE_STORE` | `database` | Cache storage |
   | `QUEUE_CONNECTION` | `database` | Queue driver |
   | `SEMAPHORE_API_KEY` | (your key) | Optional: SMS API key |
   | `SEMAPHORE_SENDER_NAME` | `BITSI` | SMS sender name |

4. **Connect MySQL to Web Service**
   - In your web service, add a variable: `DB_URL = ${{MySQL.MYSQL_URL}}`
   - Or use individual variables: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`

5. **Configure Health Check**
   - Railway will automatically use the `/up` endpoint for health checks
   - The endpoint is defined in `routes/web.php`

### Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `railway.toml` | Railway-specific deployment configuration |
| `nixpacks.toml` | Build configuration for Nixpacks builder |
| `railpack.json` | PHP extensions and build settings |

### Health Check Endpoint

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/up` that returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-23T14:30:00+00:00"
}
```

This endpoint is used by Railway to monitor application health.

### Troubleshooting Deployment

<details>
<summary><strong>Database connection errors</strong></summary>

Ensure `DB_URL` is correctly referencing the MySQL service:
- Variable should be `DB_URL = ${{MySQL.MYSQL_URL}}`
- Check that MySQL service is running
- Verify the database was created (migrations run automatically on deploy)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Application key not set</strong></summary>

Generate an app key locally and set it as a Railway variable:
```bash
php artisan key:generate --show
# Copy the output and set as APP_KEY in Railway
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build failures</strong></summary>

1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all required PHP extensions are listed in `railpack.json`
3. Verify `composer.json` has correct PHP version requirements
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Memory or timeout issues</strong></summary>

- Upgrade to a higher tier plan if needed
- Increase health check timeout in `railway.toml`
- Consider using a separate worker for queues
</details>
